{"name":"BQdu","tagline":"BigQuery Disk Usage to visualize the storage used by BQ's datasets/tables","body":"### Welcome to BQdu\r\nIf you're using Google BigQuery as part of your daily work, chances you're asking yourself questions like 'How much data do I have in BigQuery?' or 'Which datasets hold the most data in my project' or maybe even 'What tables are largest within my dataset' all the time.\r\n\r\nInspired by Linux's 'du', BQdu was created as small service which does exactly what 'du' does for folders but only for Google BigQuery's projects, datasets and tables.\r\n\r\nBQdu will scan your project/s and display a treemap visualization of your project, datasets and tables. You can mouse-over each tile and get a nice tooltip with information about the entity you're pointing to. Tiles are sized according to their relative size compared to the dataset (and datasets to projects).\r\n\r\n![BQdu Screenshot](http://storage.googleapis.com/bqdu-images/bqdu.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBQdu was created by [Vadim Solovey](mailto:vadim@doit-intl.com) - Google Developer Expert and CTO of DoIT International.\r\n\r\n### Privacy Policy\r\nYou can see our privacy policy at bqdu.info/privacy\r\n","google":"UA-39701609-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
